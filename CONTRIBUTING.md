A CLA is a document that specifies how a project is allowed to use your code. We want a CLA that is simple and as clear as possible so that it doesn't disrupt contributions.
When you make a contribution to the project, you agree:

* The code you wrote is your original work (you own the copyright) or you otherwise have the right to submit the work.
* You grant the project a nonexclusive, irrevocable license to use your submitted code in any way.
* You are capable of granting these rights for the contribution.

By submitting a fix you agree to the above statements.
